## Headline

> **XGBoost wins: MAE = 0.256 and RMSE = 0.380 in log1p space — MASE 0.70, i.e. ~30% better than repeating last week.** The useful negative result is that LSTM and Transformer do not beat the gradient-boosted baseline on this structured forecasting task after leakage fixes; all models do beat the seasonal-naive benchmark (MASE < 1).

The pipeline systematically benchmarks a seasonal-naive (t-7) baseline, XGBoost, Prophet, LSTM, and Transformer on tabular retail time-series data with heavy feature engineering (40+ lag / rolling / holiday / oil-price features). Once hand-crafted features cover the long-range dependencies, gradient boosting exploits those structured features more efficiently — deep learning does not necessarily beat a well-built baseline, which is itself a valuable engineering finding.

| Model | MAE ↓ | RMSE ↓ | MAPE ↓ | sMAPE | MASE ↓ |
|-------|------:|-------:|-------:|------:|-------:|
| Seasonal Naive (t-7) | 0.361 | 0.569 | 17.61% | 23.31% | 0.991 |
| **XGBoost** | **0.256** | **0.380** | **11.98%** | 39.46% | **0.702** |
| LSTM | 0.269 | 0.399 | 12.71% | 40.66% | 0.738 |
| Transformer | 0.282 | 0.410 | 12.76% | 40.61% | 0.774 |

The rerun fixes three leakage paths: oil lags are computed on the date-unique series, missing oil values use causal filling, and deep-learning validation targets are restricted to the holdout window. The contract is covered by `tests/test_pipeline.py::TestLeakagePrevention`; metrics come from `reports/model_results.json`.

## Overview

End-to-end pipeline for multivariate time series forecasting. Benchmarks classical methods (XGBoost, Prophet) against modern neural architectures (LSTM, Transformer) on the Kaggle Store Sales dataset.

## Key Highlights

- **Baseline Models**: Seasonal-naive (t-7), XGBoost Regressor + Facebook Prophet for benchmarking
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM with embedding layers + Transformer with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding
- **Feature Engineering**: Lag features (1/7/14/28/364d), rolling statistics, cyclical seasonal encodings, promo aggregates
- **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, sMAPE + MASE/RMSSE scaled errors vs. the seasonal-naive benchmark
- **Delivery**: Streamlit dashboard comparing forecast vs. actual

## Leakage Prevention

Leakage systematically inflates time-series metrics. This pipeline fixes three leakage paths:

- **Oil lag computed on the daily series**: an early version applied `shift(1)` directly on the long table, which crossed (store, family) group boundaries. The lag is now computed on a date-unique frame and merged back, so `oil_lag_1` is always the previous day's oil price.
- **Causal filling of missing oil prices**: `interpolate(method="linear")` is bidirectional (it could pull future oil prices into the validation window); it has been replaced with `ffill().bfill()` only, so a given day's oil price never comes from later observations.
- **DL validation-target filtering**: `TimeSeriesDataset(min_target_date=val_start)` only emits samples whose prediction target is ≥ val_start. The 28 days of training tail ahead of the validation window serve as window input only — never as prediction targets mixed into validation loss/MAE.

## Model Comparison

### Evaluation protocol

Kaggle scores original-scale sales with RMSLE, while this repository currently reports MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and sMAPE in log1p(sales) space, plus MASE/RMSSE against a seasonal-naive (t-7) benchmark. These protocols are not directly comparable, so this README shows only local results backed by `reports/model_results.json` on the shared chronological holdout; unsupported RMSLE and leaderboard estimates have been removed.

**Seasonal-naive & MASE**: the naive baseline predicts ŷ(t) = y(t−7) per (store, family) series — the same "condition on actual recent history" protocol as the lag-feature models. MASE = holdout MAE / in-sample seasonal-naive MAE (pooled over all training series, scale = 0.365 in log1p space); MASE < 1 means better than repeating last week. Details: `reports/seasonal_naive_baseline.md`.

### Results

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | sMAPE | MASE | Dataset |
|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|---------|
| Seasonal Naive (t-7) | 0.361 | 0.569 | 17.61% | 23.31% | 0.991 | Full processed training set, final 16-day holdout |
| XGBoost | **0.256** | **0.380** | **11.98%** | 39.46% | **0.702** | Full processed training set, final 16-day holdout |
| Prophet (aggregated) | — | — | — | — | — | *(requires pystan compilation toolchain; verified in Docker/Linux CI)* |
| LSTM | 0.269 | 0.399 | 12.71% | 40.66% | 0.738* | Same chronological holdout |
| Transformer | 0.282 | 0.410 | 12.76% | 40.61% | 0.774* | Same chronological holdout |

\* LSTM/Transformer MASE is derived from their aggregate MAE and the pooled seasonal-naive scale (per-row predictions from the GPU runs are not persisted).

> **LSTM/Transformer metrics** are actual full-dataset results produced by PyTorch Lightning training on the same validation window as XGBoost. Run `make train-lstm` and `make train-transformer` to regenerate them; metrics are written to `reports/model_results.json` under `"lstm_results"` / `"transformer_results"` keys. The XGBoost MAE in this table is cross-checked against `reports/model_results.json` by `python -m foresight.audit_consistency` (`make audit`).

> All MAE/RMSE/MAPE values are computed in log1p(sales) space. Every model — XGBoost included — is evaluated on the same chronological 16-day holdout at the tail of the training series (no shuffle, no cross-validation).

<summary><b>📊 Detailed experiment notes (training speed, improvement ideas)</b></summary>

### Training speed (2.3M samples / RTX 4060)

An early single-threaded DataLoader (`num_workers=0`) left the GPU waiting between steps and was the main reason DL training was slow. With multi-process data loading enabled, per-epoch time dropped significantly:

| Optimization | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| `num_workers=4 + persistent_workers` | 4 processes run `__getitem__` in parallel; workers are spawned once and reused across epochs |
| `prefetch_factor=4` | Prefetch queue keeps the GPU fed |
| `pin_memory + non_blocking` | Host→device copies overlap with compute |
| `cudnn.benchmark=True` | Auto-selects the fastest kernel for the fixed 28-step windows |
| `bf16-mixed` precision | Ada Tensor Core acceleration |
| `batch_size=1024` | Cuts kernel-launch overhead (bs=128: 72s/epoch → bs=1024: 38s/epoch) |

> Tune via CLI: `python -m foresight.train_lstm --num_workers 8 --batch_size 2048`. If a long run is interrupted, `--resume` continues from the latest checkpoint in `reports/checkpoints/`.

### Why DL did not win, and improvement ideas

LSTM comes close to XGBoost (MAE gap 0.012); Transformer lags slightly. Improvement ideas: longer training, a larger `d_model`, or dedicated time-series architectures such as N-BEATS / TFT.

## Rolling-Origin Backtest

A single chronological holdout is one draw from one window — the score can be lucky or unlucky depending on which 16 days happen to be at the tail. Random k-fold CV is **not** a valid alternative for time series: shuffling puts future rows into the training set and leaks autocorrelated neighbours across the fold boundary, biasing scores optimistically. The standard fix is **rolling-origin (walk-forward) evaluation**: an expanding training window re-scored on several non-overlapping future horizons. `src/foresight/backtest.py` retrains XGBoost from scratch on 5 origins (16-day horizon each, same as the single holdout) and re-scores the seasonal-naive baseline per fold, so the MASE denominator (in-sample naive MAE) is recomputed on each fold's own training window:

```
date ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►
fold 1: [════════ train ════════][val]   val 2017-05-28 ~ 06-12
fold 2: [════════ train ════════════][val]   val 2017-06-13 ~ 06-28
fold 3: [════════ train ═════════════════][val]   val 2017-06-29 ~ 07-14
fold 4: [════════ train ═════════════════════][val]   val 2017-07-15 ~ 07-30
fold 5: [════════ train ═════════════════════════][val]   val 2017-07-31 ~ 08-15
                                     ▲ train never touches its val window or anything after
```

Per-fold metrics (log1p space; fold 5 is exactly the single-holdout window and reproduces its numbers — MAE 0.2562 / MASE 0.7023 vs. 0.256 / 0.702 — as a built-in consistency check):

| Fold | Val window | XGB MAE | XGB RMSE | XGB MAPE | XGB MASE | Naive MASE | MASE scale |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 2017-05-28 ~ 06-12 | 0.255 | 0.379 | 12.32% | 0.696 | 0.955 | 0.366 |
| 2 | 2017-06-13 ~ 06-28 | 0.254 | 0.378 | 12.18% | 0.694 | 0.927 | 0.366 |
| 3 | 2017-06-29 ~ 07-14 | 0.246 | 0.369 | 11.90% | 0.674 | 0.932 | 0.366 |
| 4 | 2017-07-15 ~ 07-30 | 0.250 | 0.374 | 11.92% | 0.685 | 0.882 | 0.365 |
| 5 | 2017-07-31 ~ 08-15 | 0.256 | 0.381 | 11.98% | 0.702 | 0.991 | 0.365 |

Mean ± std across the 5 folds vs. the single-holdout numbers from the table above (full per-fold values in `reports/backtest_results.json`; reproduce with `make backtest`):

| Metric | XGB rolling mean ± std | XGB single holdout | Single within ±1 std? |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| MAE | 0.252 ± 0.004 | 0.256 | ✓ (0.96σ) |
| RMSE | 0.376 ± 0.005 | 0.380 | ✓ (0.91σ) |
| MAPE | 12.06% ± 0.18% | 11.98% | ✓ (−0.43σ) |
| sMAPE | 39.30% ± 0.55% | 39.46% | ✓ (0.29σ) |
| MASE | 0.690 ± 0.011 | 0.702 | ✗ — marginally outside (1.08σ) |
| Naive MASE | 0.937 ± 0.040 | 0.991 | ✗ — marginally outside (1.34σ) |

**Conclusion: the model is stable, the split was (very) slightly unlucky.** XGBoost fold-to-fold spread is tiny (MASE std ≈ 1.6% of the mean), so the ranking over the naive baseline is robust; the single-holdout MASE of 0.702 sits ~1.1σ above the rolling mean of 0.690, i.e. the final 16-day window was marginally harder than a typical window — the honest "model quality" number is **MASE ≈ 0.69 ± 0.01**, not a single point estimate.

## Data

The project uses the **Kaggle Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting** dataset:
- 54 stores across Ecuador
- 33 product families
- Daily sales from 2013 to 2017
- External variables: oil prices, holidays, promotions

For local testing without Kaggle credentials, run `python -m foresight.generate_mock_data` to create a statistically similar synthetic dataset.
